### 1. **Scraping**
- Scraped the PDF version of the Constitution directly from the Pakistan Code website.
- Ensured the data is obtained from a **public domain government source**.
- Downloaded and stored the official PDF.

### 2. **Conversion to Text**    
- Used `pdfminer.six` / `PyPDF2` to extract clean text from the PDF.
- Preserved headings, sections, and article numbers for legal accuracy.
- Removed headers, footers, and formatting artifacts.

### 3. **Structuring into JSONL**
- Transformed the text into **JSON Lines** format for training legal language models.
- Each line contains:
```json
{
  "article": "Article 19",
  "text": "Every citizen shall have the right to freedom of speech and expression..."
}
